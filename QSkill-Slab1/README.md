##  Task 1: Data Analysis and Visualization using Pandas & Matplotlib

**Objective:**  
To perform basic data analysis on a CSV dataset and visualize insights.

**What was done:**
- Loaded the dataset using the Pandas library
- Performed basic inspection and calculated the average of a numerical column
- Created different visualizations to analyze the data:
  - Bar chart
  - Scatter plot
  - Heatmap for correlation analysis

**Outcome:**  
The task helped in understanding how raw data can be analyzed and visualized to extract meaningful insights.

##  Task 2: House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

**Objective:**  
To build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on given features.

**What was done:**
- Collected a housing dataset
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data
- Converted categorical values into numerical format
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Linear Regression model
- Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score
- Visualized actual vs predicted house prices
- Predicted the price of a new house using the trained model

**Outcome:**  
The model demonstrated good prediction accuracy, showing the effectiveness of linear regression for basic price prediction problems.
